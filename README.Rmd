# parquetr

The goal of parquetr is to let you read parquet files into R without using a spark connection.  At present it is the simplest version from getting the job done (a wrapper for pandas read_parquet through reticulate) but hopefully will improve and expand in the future.

## Installation

You can install the development version of parquetr with `devtools::install_github('alexpavlakis/parquetr')`


## Example

Parquetr makes it easy to read and write parquet files.

```{r example}
library(parquetr)

# Write iris as a parquet file
tf <- tempfile()
write_parquet(iris, tf)

# Read the parquet file back as a tibble
iris2 <- read_parquet(tf)
head(iris2)
```
